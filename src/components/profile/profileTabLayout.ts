/**
 * Profile tab layout — SSOT for which profile tabs are primary vs. overflow.
 *
 * A profile can surface up to ~13 tabs (Overview, Info, Timeline, Projects, and
 * one per public entity type, plus People and Wallets). Showing all of them at
 * once is exactly the cognitive overload we want to avoid: keep the few tabs
 * people actually use up front, and tuck the long tail behind a "More" menu.
 *
 * This is the single decision point — change PRIMARY_PROFILE_TAB_IDS to re-rank
 * what stays visible. `partitionTabs` is pure so it can be unit-tested and reused
 * by the tab bar without pulling in React.
