/**
 * "Revive My Old Ride" — OrangeCat-side SSOT
 *
 * The economic/outward half of a revamp-it initiative. OrangeCat is the layer
 * that *markets* it (public project, Supporters, the Cat's outward voice);
 * FleetCrown is the layer that *executes* it (agent-fleet dispatch, ops).
 *
 * This file is the single source of truth for the project's canonical content
 * and for the seed that registers it on-platform
 * (scripts/seed-revive-my-old-ride.ts). The copy is defined ONCE here and
 * reused by the seed today and any /projects rendering or Cat context later.
 *
 * On-platform ownership: there is no separate "revamp-it" actor — the founder's
 * platform identity is the `mao` actor (Mao Nakamoto), which already owns the
 * "FleetCrown" and "OrangeCat" projects. Revive My Old Ride is owned the same
 * way, with revamp-it represented as an external stakeholder link. Swap to a
 * dedicated revamp-it actor/group later by changing OWNER_ACTOR_SLUG.
