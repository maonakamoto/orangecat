 * Single source of truth for "is this nav href currently active".
 *
 * Used by every chrome surface (sidebar, header desktop nav, mobile
 * bottom nav). Don't grow a fourth implementation — extend this one.
 *
 * Rules:
 *   - Exact pathname === href → active
 *   - `/dashboard` (the dashboard home) is active only on its own path,
 *     NOT on `/dashboard/x` — otherwise it would always look active when
 *     the user is on any sub-page like /dashboard/projects.
 *   - Every other href is active on its own path AND any sub-path
 *     prefixed by `${href}/`.
 *   - `/` is only active on `/` exactly (avoids matching every URL).
