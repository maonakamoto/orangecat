    question: 'Is it safe to use a Bitcoin wallet?',
    answer:
      'Yes, when used properly. Bitcoin wallets use strong cryptography. The key is to choose a reputable wallet, keep your recovery phrase secure, and never share your private keys with anyone.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to pay to create a wallet?',
    answer:
      'No, creating a Bitcoin wallet is free. You only pay network fees when sending Bitcoin transactions. Receiving Bitcoin is always free.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I lose my recovery phrase?',
    answer:
      "If you lose your recovery phrase and can't access your wallet, your Bitcoin will be permanently lost. This is why it's crucial to write it down and store it safely offline.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use the same address multiple times?',
    answer:
      "Yes, you can reuse Bitcoin addresses, but it's better for privacy to generate a new address for each transaction. Most modern wallets do this automatically.",
  },
