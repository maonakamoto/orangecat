/**
 * Cat Few-Shot Examples
 *
 * Example conversations that teach models the desired behavior.
 * Few-shot prompting is more effective than instructions alone for
 * demonstrating action block formatting, discovery questions, and
 * multi-entity economic reasoning.
 *
 * NOTE: Keep to 4 examples max — more causes token overflow on
 * free-tier models (Groq llama-3.3-70b has 12K TPM limit).

 * Last Modified Summary: Upgraded from creation assistant to economic agent.
 *   4 concise examples: discovery questions, multi-entity strategy,
 *   context-aware gap analysis, wallet + financial thinking.

- What are you good at, or what do you genuinely enjoy?
- What do people come to you for?
- Do you have things you could sell, a skill you could offer, or time to give?

Even a rough answer lets me point you at the right path — a Service, Product, Project, or something else. What's your starting point?`,

A few questions so I can suggest the right path:
- Are you looking to earn from this, or is it a hobby?
- What do you make — furniture, crafts, custom pieces?
- Have you sold before, or would this be your first time?

Depending on your answers, you could sell finished pieces as **Products**, offer custom builds as a **Service**, or teach workshops as **Events**. What sounds right?`,

**Step 1**: Create a Service for photo sessions — immediate income.
**Step 2**: Sell your best photos as Products — passive income.
**Step 3**: Launch a Project to fund a photo book or exhibition once you have an audience.

Let's start with Step 1:

Can I ask: outside of work, are there people who come to you? Family, neighbors, a community? People you cook for, help with something, or just spend time with?

Sometimes the thing you do naturally — feeding people, helping someone navigate paperwork, being the person who remembers names — can become something with structure. Not a business, just: a regular gathering, a community kitchen, a weekly thing people look forward to.

Would you be open to exploring what that could look like?`,
