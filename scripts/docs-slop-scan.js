  docs-slop-scan.js
  Scans production code (src/, app/) for sloppy placeholder phrases.

  Why src/ + app/ only: docs/ legitimately contains "TODO" (in
  forward-looking/ROADMAP.md status markers, TASK_QUEUE.md, etc.) and
  "TBD" (sprint planning), which are intentional authoring, not slop.
  This script's job is to catch slop that would ship to a USER —
  lorem-ipsum copy, lazy "TBD" labels, half-written feature stubs.

  Why these specific phrases (and not others):
  - "lorem ipsum"      — never legitimately shipped
  - "tbd" / "todo" / "wip" / "work in progress" — productionised
                         laziness when in src code
  - "beta only"        — usually a planning artifact, shouldn't ship

  Phrases deliberately NOT scanned:
  - "placeholder"      — matches React `placeholder` attrs, type
                         fields, and Tailwind `placeholder:` variant
                         classes everywhere. Way too coarse.
  - "coming soon"      — OrangeCat literally has a /coming-soon page
                         and a COMING_SOON config constant. The phrase
                         is a feature name in this codebase, not slop.
