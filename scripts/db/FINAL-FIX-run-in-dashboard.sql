-- ============================================================================
-- FINAL FIX FOR AVATAR UPLOAD RLS
-- Run this via psql "$POSTGRES_URL" on the self-hosted DB (supabase.orangecat.ch) - managed cloud retired
-- ============================================================================

-- Set role to postgres (superuser) to have permission to modify storage.objects
SET ROLE postgres;

-- Enable RLS on storage.objects
ALTER TABLE storage.objects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop all existing avatar-related policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload their own profile images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own profile images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public profiles bucket is publicly readable" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload their own avatars" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own avatars" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own avatars" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public avatars bucket is publicly readable" ON storage.objects;

-- Create INSERT policy (allows users to upload their own avatars)
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatars"
ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Create UPDATE policy (allows users to update their own avatars)
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatars"
ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
)
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Create DELETE policy (allows users to delete their own avatars)
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own avatars"
ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Create SELECT policy (allows public to read all avatars)
CREATE POLICY "Public avatars bucket is publicly readable"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- Reset role
RESET ROLE;

-- Verify the policies were created
SELECT
  policyname,
  cmd AS operation,
  roles
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'objects'
  AND schemaname = 'storage'
  AND policyname LIKE '%avatar%'
ORDER BY policyname;
