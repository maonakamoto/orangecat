# OrangeCat self-host migration apply — the SSOT for getting supabase/migrations/*
# onto the box DB. Kills the "manually psql a migration and forget" drift class
# that caused a whole family of prod 500s.
#
# The self-host has no Supabase-CLI migration tracking. Applied files are recorded
# in public.schema_migrations (filename text PK, applied_at timestamptz), one-time
# backfilled with the 147 pre-existing migrations on 2026-06-18. This script:
#
#   1. Ensures the tracking table exists (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS).
#   2. Refuses to run a full replay against an already-populated DB: if the
#      tracking table is EMPTY but core app tables exist, it aborts and tells you
#      to run --backfill (mark everything up-to-now as applied, never re-run).
#   3. Applies pending *.sql in filename order, EACH inside a single transaction
#      (`psql -1`), recording the filename only after success.
#   4. Aborts non-zero on the first failure, printing the failing filename —
#      callers (deploy) must treat that as a hard stop.
#
# `-1` (single-transaction) is CRITICAL: it wraps each migration in BEGIN/COMMIT
# so a mid-file failure ROLLS BACK every statement. Without it, a migration that
# drops a view early then fails later leaves the schema half-applied — it dropped
# a live view the app needs but never recreated it (a real prod regression on
# 2026-06-19). No migration uses CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY (verified), so
# single-txn mode is safe.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/apply-migrations.sh              # apply pending, record, abort on failure
#   scripts/apply-migrations.sh --dry-run    # list pending only, change nothing
#   scripts/apply-migrations.sh --backfill   # bootstrap: record ALL current files as
#                                            # applied WITHOUT running them (only for a
#                                            # DB that predates tracking / already has
#                                            # the schema). Idempotent.
