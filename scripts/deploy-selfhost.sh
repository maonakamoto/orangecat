# OrangeCat self-host deploy — atomic swap + boot-test + rollback.
#
# OrangeCat is one of the four hand-rolled "snowflake" services on bitbaum
# (not managed by fleetcrown/scripts/hetzner/sync-infra.sh, not in apps.conf):
# it keeps its own systemd unit + Caddy block and uses this safer deploy than
# the fleet's in-place `deploy.sh` (which rsyncs over the live tree with no
# rollback). The flow, proven in the runbook:
#
#   build standalone (off-box) → assemble static+public → rsync to a STAGING
#   dir → boot-test on a scratch port → atomic swap live↔staging (keep backup)
#   → restart service → health-check → auto-rollback on failure → verify public.
#
# The box build OOMs, so we always build locally / in CI and ship the artifact.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/deploy-selfhost.sh              # build, then deploy
#   scripts/deploy-selfhost.sh --no-build   # deploy an already-built .next/standalone (CI)
#
# Config (env, with proven defaults):
#   OC_BOX        SSH target              (default root@167.233.22.31)
#   OC_APP_BASE   app dir on box          (default /opt/orangecat)
#   OC_SERVICE    systemd unit            (default orangecat-app)
#   OC_PORT       live port               (default 4003)
#   OC_BOOT_PORT  scratch boot-test port  (default 4099)
#   OC_HEALTH     health path             (default /api/health)
#   OC_PUBLIC     public health URL       (default https://orangecat.ch/api/health)
