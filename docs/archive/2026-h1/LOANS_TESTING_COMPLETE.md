## 🔍 Issues Found

### Minor Issues

1. **Bulk Actions Bar Persists Across Tabs**
   - **Issue:** The bulk actions bar remains visible when switching to "Browse" or "Offers" tabs, even though those tabs don't support bulk selection
   - **Impact:** Low - cosmetic issue, doesn't affect functionality
   - **Recommendation:** Hide bulk actions bar when not on "Mine" tab

### Non-Issues (Working as Expected)

1. **Empty States** - "No loans available" message in Browse tab is correct behavior
2. **Select Button Visibility** - Only shows when loans exist (correct)
3. **Bulk Selection Mode** - Correctly toggles between normal and selection modes
