# Loan UX - First Principles Analysis & Recommendation

**Date:** 2025-12-31  
**Status:** Analysis & Design Recommendation  
**Approach:** First Principles + Engineering Principles + Dev Guide

---

## 🎯 User Goals (From First Principles)

### Core User Intent

1. **Borrower (New Loan Request):** "I need money. I want to request a loan and offer collateral."
2. **Borrower (Existing Loan):** "I have an existing loan. I want to refinance it to get better terms."
3. **Lender:** "I want to find loan requests or existing loans to refinance, and make offers."

### User Journeys

#### Journey 1: Create New Loan Request

```
User → "I need a loan" → Create Loan → Select "New Loan Request" →
Fill form (amount, purpose, terms) → Add collateral → Publish →
Lenders discover → Make offers → User accepts → Loan created
```

#### Journey 2: Add Existing Loan for Refinancing

```
User → "I want to refinance" → Create Loan → Select "Add Existing Loan" →
Fill form (current lender, balance, terms) → Add collateral → Publish →
Lenders discover → Make offers → User accepts → Refinanced
```

#### Journey 3: Discover & Refinance

```
Lender → Browse Loans → Filter by type (new/existing) → View details →
Make offer → Borrower accepts → Refinance completed
```

#### Journey 4: Profile-Based Discovery

```
User → View Profile → See loans section → Click loan → Make offer
```

#### Journey 5: Share & Refinance

```
Borrower → Share loan link → Lender clicks → View loan → Make offer
```

## 🔍 Current State Analysis

### What Exists

1. ✅ Database schema supports `loan_type` (`new_request` | `existing_refinance`)
2. ✅ Database supports wallet collateral (migration applied)
3. ✅ Basic loan creation form exists
4. ✅ "Browse" tab shows available loans
5. ✅ Offer system exists (`MakeOfferDialog`)

### What's Missing

1. ❌ **No mode selection in UI** - Form doesn't ask "new request" vs "existing loan"
2. ❌ **No distinction in form fields** - Same fields for both types
3. ❌ **No search/discovery for loans** - Loans not in main search/discover
4. ❌ **No profile integration** - Loans not shown on user profiles
5. ❌ **No sharing mechanism** - No shareable loan links
6. ❌ **No filtering by loan type** - Can't filter "new requests" vs "existing loans"
7. ❌ **No wallet collateral UI** - Only assets supported in UI

## 💡 Recommended Solution (First Principles)

### Principle 1: Clear User Intent → Clear UI

**Problem:** User doesn't know they can create two types of loans.

**Solution:** **Mode Selection at Entry Point**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Create Loan                            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│  What would you like to do?             │
│                                         │
│  ┌──────────────────────┐              │
│  │ 🆕 Request New Loan  │              │
│  │                      │              │
│  │ I need to borrow     │              │
│  │ money. I'll offer    │              │
│  │ collateral.          │              │
│  └──────────────────────┘              │
│                                         │
│  ┌──────────────────────┐              │
│  │ 🔄 Refinance Loan   │              │
│  │                      │              │
│  │ I have an existing   │              │
│  │ loan I want to      │              │
│  │ refinance.           │              │
│  └──────────────────────┘              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Principle 2: Context-Appropriate Forms

**New Loan Request Form:**

- Focus: Amount needed, purpose, repayment ability
- Fields: Title, Description, Amount, Interest Rate, Collateral
- **No** current lender info needed

**Existing Loan Form:**

- Focus: Current loan details, why refinance
- Fields: Title, Description, **Current Lender**, **Current Balance**, **Current Interest Rate**, **Remaining Term**, Collateral
- **Additional** fields for existing loan context

### Principle 3: Discovery & Search (SSOT)

**Problem:** Loans are isolated - not discoverable.

**Solution:** Integrate loans into existing discovery patterns:

1. **Add to `/discover` page:**
   - New tab: "Loans"
   - Filter by: `loan_type` (new_request | existing_refinance)
   - Filter by: amount range, interest rate, category

2. **Add to search:**
   - Include loans in global search
   - Search by: title, description, borrower name

3. **Profile integration:**
   - Add "Loans" section to profile page
   - Show: Active loans, loan requests, refinancing opportunities
   - Public loans visible to all, private loans to owner

4. **Shareable links:**
   - `/loans/[id]` - Public loan detail page
   - Share button on loan card
   - Direct link to make offer

### Principle 4: Modular & DRY (Engineering Principles)

**Current Issue:** Loan creation is custom, not using modular patterns.

**Solution:** Use existing modular components:

```typescript
// Use EntityForm with conditional fields
<EntityForm
  config={loanConfig}
  mode={loanType} // 'new_request' | 'existing_refinance'
  conditionalFields={{
    'existing_refinance': [
      'current_lender_name',
      'current_lender_contact',
      'current_loan_number',
      'current_origination_date',
      'current_maturity_date'
    ]
  }}
/>
```

---

## 🏗️ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Mode Selection & Form Updates

**1.1 Add Mode Selector Component**

```typescript
// src/components/loans/LoanModeSelector.tsx
export function LoanModeSelector({
  value,
  onChange,
}: {
  value: 'new_request' | 'existing_refinance';
  onChange: (mode: typeof value) => void;
}) {
  // Two-card selection UI
}
```

**1.2 Update Loan Config**

```typescript
// src/config/entity-configs/loan-config.ts
export const loanConfig = {
  // ... existing config
  modeSelector: true, // Enable mode selection
  conditionalFields: {
    existing_refinance: [
      'current_lender_name',
      'current_lender_contact',
      'current_loan_number',
      'current_origination_date',
      'current_maturity_date',
    ],
  },
};
```

**1.3 Update Validation Schema**

```typescript
// src/lib/validation.ts
export const loanSchema = z.object({
  loan_type: z.enum(['new_request', 'existing_refinance']),
  // ... existing fields
  // Conditional fields
  current_lender_name: z.string().optional(),
  current_lender_contact: z.string().optional(),
  // ... only required when loan_type === 'existing_refinance'
}).refine(...)
```

### Phase 2: Discovery Integration

**2.1 Add Loans to Discover Page**

```typescript
// src/app/discover/page.tsx
type DiscoverTabType = 'all' | 'projects' | 'profiles' | 'loans'; // Add 'loans'

// Add loans tab with filters:
// - loan_type (new_request | existing_refinance)
// - amount_range
// - interest_rate_range
// - category
```

**2.2 Add Loans to Search**

```typescript
// src/services/search.ts
export async function search(options: SearchOptions) {
  // ... existing code
  if (type === 'all' || type === 'loans') {
    const loans = await searchLoans(query, filters, limit, offset);
    // ... add to results
  }
}
```

**2.3 Profile Integration**

```typescript
// src/app/profiles/[username]/page.tsx
// Add "Loans" section showing:
// - User's active loans (if public or owner)
// - Loan requests (if public or owner)
// - Refinancing opportunities (if public)
```

**2.4 Shareable Loan Links**

```typescript
// src/app/loans/[id]/page.tsx (public route)
// Public loan detail page with:
// - Loan information
// - Make Offer button (if authenticated)
// - Share button
// - Borrower profile link
```

### Phase 3: Collateral System

**3.1 Wallet Collateral UI**

```typescript
// src/components/loans/CollateralSection.tsx
// Add tabs: "Assets" | "Wallets"
// Show user's wallets with balance
// Allow selection of multiple wallets
// Calculate total collateral value
```

**3.2 Total Collateral Calculation**

```typescript
// src/domain/loans/collateral.ts
export async function calculateTotalCollateral(loanId: string) {
  // Sum all asset values + wallet balances
  // Convert to common currency
  // Return total
}
```

### Phase 4: Enhanced Browse Experience

**4.1 Filter by Loan Type**

```typescript
// src/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/loans/page.tsx
// Add filter chips:
// - "New Requests" (loan_type = 'new_request')
// - "Refinancing" (loan_type = 'existing_refinance')
// - "All"
```

**4.2 Loan Type Badges**

```typescript
// src/config/entities/loans.tsx
makeCardProps: loan => ({
  // ... existing props
  badge: loan.loan_type === 'new_request' ? 'New Request' : 'Refinancing',
  badgeVariant: loan.loan_type === 'new_request' ? 'primary' : 'secondary',
});
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Recommendations

### Mode Selector Design

**Option A: Card Selection (Recommended)**

- Two large cards side-by-side
- Clear icons and descriptions
- Selected state: border + background color
- Mobile: Stacked vertically

**Option B: Tabs**

- Two tabs at top of form
- "New Request" | "Refinance"
- Less visual, but familiar pattern

**Recommendation:** Option A (Card Selection) - More visual, clearer intent

### Form Layout
