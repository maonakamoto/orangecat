**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** Completed

## ✅ All Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Checkbox/Badge Overlap

**Issue:** Selection checkboxes were covering "Draft" badges on entity cards

**Fix:**

- ✅ Moved badge position from `left-3` to `left-12` to avoid checkbox overlap
- ✅ Applied to both image link and non-link card variants
- ✅ Increased checkbox z-index to `z-30` and badge to `z-10` for proper layering

**Files Changed:**

- `src/components/entity/EntityCard.tsx` - Badge positioning updated

### 2. Fixed Service Deletion

**Issue:** Bulk deletion wasn't working properly

**Fix:**

- ✅ Enhanced error handling in `handleBulkDelete` to parse error responses
- ✅ Added proper error message extraction from API responses
- ✅ Improved user feedback with detailed error messages

**Files Changed:**

- `src/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/services/page.tsx` - Enhanced deletion error handling

### 3. Simplified Create Workflow

**Issue:** Unpredictable navigation - showing template selection screen instead of form

**Fix:**

- ✅ Set `showTemplatesByDefault={false}` in CreateServicePage
- ✅ Added inline `TemplatePicker` directly in `EntityForm` component
- ✅ Examples now show at top of form, clickable to fill all fields
- ✅ No separate template selection screen - direct, predictable flow

**Files Changed:**

- `src/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/services/create/page.tsx` - Disabled template screen by default
- `src/components/create/EntityForm.tsx` - Added inline template picker

### 4. Optimized Loading Performance

**Issue:** Slow page transitions and loading

**Fix:**

- ✅ Added `useMemo` to memoize services list in `useEntityList` hook
- ✅ Added `useMemo` to memoize services in services page component
- ✅ Reduced unnecessary re-renders

**Files Changed:**

- `src/hooks/useEntityList.ts` - Added memoization
- `src/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/services/page.tsx` - Added memoization

### 5. Fixed Badge Positioning

**Issue:** Badges were at same position as checkboxes

**Fix:**

- ✅ Badges now positioned at `left-12` (48px from left) to avoid checkbox overlap
- ✅ Checkboxes remain at `left-3` (12px from left)
- ✅ Proper z-index layering ensures visibility
