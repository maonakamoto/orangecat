# Entity Pages DRY Fixes Summary

**Created:** 2025-01-30  
**Purpose:** Summary of DRY violations fixed and remaining issues

---

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Removed BitBaum Text from Logo

- **File:** `src/components/layout/Logo.tsx`
- **Change:** Removed "A BitBaum Company" text under OrangeCat logo
- **Reason:** Excessive branding, user requested removal

### 2. Removed Experimental Banner

- **File:** `src/components/home/HomePublicClient.tsx`
- **Change:** Removed `<ExperimentalBanner />` component
- **Reason:** User requested removal - "Enough with that"

### 3. Refactored Loans Page

- **File:** `src/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/loans/page.tsx`
- **Change:** Now uses `EntityListShell` for consistent layout
- **Details:**
  - Moved stats cards inside EntityListShell
  - Removed duplicate header (handled by EntityListShell)
  - Removed duplicate "Add Loan" button from LoanDashboard
  - Kept LoanDashboard tabs functionality

## 📋 Current Entity Pages Status

### ✅ Using EntityListShell (DRY, Consistent)

- `/dashboard/store` (Products)
- `/dashboard/services`
- `/dashboard/causes`
- `/dashboard/assets`
- `/dashboard/ai-assistants`
- `/dashboard/groups`
- `/dashboard/loans` (just refactored)

### ⚠️ Using Different Pattern

- `/dashboard/projects` - Uses `EntityListPage` component
  - Has tabs (My Projects / Favorites)
  - Has search and filters
  - Has bulk selection/delete
  - More complex than standard entity list
  - **Decision needed:** Keep EntityListPage or refactor to EntityListShell?

---

## 🤔 Projects Page Analysis

**Current:** Uses `EntityListPage` component

**Features:**

- Tabs (My Projects / Favorites)
- Search functionality
- Status filters
- Bulk selection
- Bulk delete
- Custom header with icon

**Options:**

1. **Keep EntityListPage** - If it's a legitimate different pattern for complex pages
2. **Refactor to EntityListShell** - Wrap tabs/search/filters inside EntityListShell (like Groups page)

**Recommendation:** Refactor to EntityListShell for consistency. Projects can have tabs inside EntityListShell, similar to Groups page.

---

## 🎯 Remaining Tasks

1. **Review Projects Page:**
   - Decide if EntityListPage is necessary
   - If not, refactor to use EntityListShell with tabs inside
   - Keep search/filters/bulk actions functionality

2. **Check for Other Custom Layouts:**
   - Review any other entity pages
   - Ensure all use EntityListShell or have good reason not to
