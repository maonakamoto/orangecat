# Workflow Verification Master Checklist (One-by-One)

Date: 2026-02-18
Last Modified: 2026-07-04
Last Modified Summary: Phases 1–5 audit completed; all workflow fixes committed; unit tests green.
Owner: Reliability Sweep
Objective: verify **all critical workflows** in Orangecat one by one, capture evidence, and fix failures before close.

## How this run works

- We execute workflows in strict order.
- Each item is marked: ☐ TODO / ◐ IN PROGRESS / ☑ DONE / ⚠ BLOCKED / ✗ FAILED
- Every workflow must include:
  - Test method (API, E2E, manual)
  - Result
  - Evidence (test output, screenshot, API response, commit)
  - Fix notes (if broken)

---

## Phase 0 — Preconditions

- ◐ Confirm test environment URLs and credentials are valid
- ⚠ Confirm required CI/E2E secrets exist (local runtime env missing; CI secrets required)
- ⚠ Confirm fixture user + fixture project ownership (needs explicit fixture validation in CI run)
- ☑ Confirm Cat provider key status (Groq)
- ◐ Confirm baseline commands run locally: type-check, unit tests (unit green; type-check command unstable in this host due sporadic SIGKILL)

---

## Phase 1 — Authentication & Access Control (P0)

- ☑ Login (valid credentials) — production Mao session verified 2026-07-04 (`butaeff@gmail.com`)
- ☑ Login (invalid credentials handling) — managed browser verified (`/auth/login` shows "Ungültige E-Mail-Adresse oder Passwort")
- ☑ Logout — `POST /auth/signout` → 200; protected API → 401; `/dashboard` redirects to login (2026-07-04)
- ☑ Protected route redirect for unauthenticated user (matrix p0 passed + managed browser `/dashboard` redirects to login)
- ☑ Password reset request — managed browser verified (`/auth/forgot-password` shows "E-Mail gesendet!")
- ⚠ Password reset completion — blocked without valid E2E_RESET_ACCESS_TOKEN in runtime
- ☑ Session persistence across reload — dashboard stays authed after reload (2026-07-04)

---

## Phase 2 — Project Lifecycle (P0)

- ☑ Project create route access (authenticated) — `/dashboard/projects/create` loads 4-step wizard (2026-07-04)
- ☑ Create project (happy path) — `POST /api/projects` → 201; ephemeral audit project created + deleted
- ☑ Edit project fields and persist — `PUT /api/projects/[id]` → 200 (note: `PATCH` returns 405; API is PUT-only)
- ☑ Status transitions: draft -> active — art-space draft project (2026-07-04)
- ☑ Status transitions: active -> paused — OrangeCat project (2026-07-04)
- ☑ Status transitions: paused -> active — OrangeCat project (2026-07-04)
- ☑ Status transitions: active/paused -> draft (unpublish) — allowed by transition table (2026-07-04)
- ☑ Invalid transition rejection behavior — `active` → `active` returns 422
- ☑ Publish/unpublish visibility on public surfaces — anonymous `/discover?type=projects` → 200 (2026-07-04)

---

## Phase 3 — Messaging Core (P0)

- ☑ Open/create conversation — `GET /api/messages` lists 10+; `GET /api/messages/self` → 200
- ☑ Send message — `POST /api/messages/[id]` → 201; UI send to Aslan Kurdi thread verified
- ☑ Edit message — `PATCH /api/messages/edit/[messageId]` → 200
- ☑ Delete message — `POST /api/messages/bulk-delete` with `{ conversationId, ids }` → 200 (`DELETE` on edit route is 405 by design)
- ◐ Message list consistency after mutation — API round-trip OK; UI edit/delete menu not exercised
- ☑ Conversation preview updates with latest message — list preview shows sent `ui audit …` text
- ☑ Unauthorized conversation access blocked — fake UUID → 404

---

## Phase 4 — Notifications (P0)

- ☑ Unread count fetch — production 2026-07-04: `GET /api/notifications/unread` → 200
- ☑ Mark single notification read — `POST /api/notifications/read` `{ id }` → 200 (idempotent when already read)
- ☑ Mark multiple notifications read — `POST /api/notifications/read` `{ ids }` → 200 (idempotent when already read)
- ☑ Mark all notifications read — production 2026-07-04: `POST /api/notifications/read` → 200 (after migration `20260704000000_fix_notifications_updated_at_trigger.sql`)
- ☑ Unread count decreases correctly after read actions — verified unread 0 after mark-all

---

## Phase 5 — Cat / AI Runtime (P0)

- ☑ /api/cat/chat endpoint liveness — production 2026-07-04: POST → 200
- ☑ Cat response path with configured provider — `POST /api/cat/chat` → 200, reply `CAT_OK` via OpenRouter fallback (2026-07-04)
- ☑ Provider failure behavior (invalid/missing key) is user-safe — Groq rate-limit falls back to OpenRouter; exhausted quota returns 429 with BYOK CTA (code path verified)
- ☑ Cat actions list endpoint — `GET /api/cat/actions` → 200
- ☑ Cat action approve path — `POST /api/cat/actions/[id]` invalid id → 400 "Pending action not found or already processed"
- ☑ Cat action reject path — `DELETE /api/cat/actions/[id]` → 200 `{ rejected: true }` (idempotent for missing id)

---

## Phase 6 — Entity Workflows (P1)

- ☑ Services: create/edit/list/detail — API CRUD 201/200/200/200; list UI loads (2026-07-04)
- ☑ Assets: create/edit/list/detail — fixed `owner_id` on create; API CRUD green after deploy
- ☑ Loans: create/edit/list/detail — fixed `loans_status_check` to allow `draft`; API CRUD green after deploy
- ☑ Causes: create/edit/list/detail — API CRUD green (`cause_category` must match SSOT labels)
- ☑ Events: create/edit/list/detail — API CRUD green (`is_free: true` or ticket_price/funding_goal)
- ☑ Wishlists: create/edit/list/detail — API CRUD green

---

## Phase 7 — Wallet & Payments (P1)

- ☑ Wallet list — `GET /api/wallets?profile_id=…` → 200; `/dashboard/wallets` loads (2026-07-04)
- ☑ Wallet create — valid bech32 + `category: general` → 201; LN-only wallet → 201 (2026-07-04)
- ☑ Duplicate wallet behavior — returns `duplicateWarning`, does not block create (by design)
- ☑ Wallet transfer API validation — bad UUIDs/negative amount → 400; same-wallet → 400; zero balance → 400 insufficient; foreign wallet → 404 (2026-07-04)
- ⚠ Wallet transfer happy-path — blocked: all Mao wallets `balance_btc: 0` (no safe prod funding path)

---

## Phase 8 — Groups & Social (P2)

- ☑ Group create — `POST /api/groups` with `label: circle` → 201 (requires `label` SSOT field, not just `name`)
- ☑ Group membership visibility — `GET /api/groups/[slug]/members` → 200 after WF-009 fix (returns founder member; deployed + prod-verified 2026-07-04)
- ☑ Follow/unfollow basic flow — follow Aslan → 409 already following; unfollow → 200; self-follow → 400; invalid UUID → 404 (2026-07-04)
- ☑ Timeline posting basic flow — UI compose on `/timeline` → post appears in feed (client-side timeline service, no `/api/timeline`)

---

## Phase 9 — Operational & Quality Gates

- ☑ Health endpoint behavior (rerun passed: `@p0 health endpoint responds`)
- ⚠ P0 matrix runs green in CI with required secrets (local run failed/blocked)
- ◐ No skip-based false green in required P0 checks (CI now fail-fast on missing secrets)
- ◐ Lint/type-check/unit tests pass on final state — unit 993/993 green (2026-07-04); type-check unstable in host
- ☑ Workflow YAML validity check (all `.github/workflows/*.yml` parse successfully after fixes)
