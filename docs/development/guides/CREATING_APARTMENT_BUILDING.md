# Step-by-Step: Creating an Apartment Building in OrangeCat

**Scenario:** You want to set up "Sunset Apartments" - a 20-unit residential building in Zurich with shared governance and expenses.

**Time Required:** ~30 minutes  
**What You'll Create:**

1. Building Group (community aspect)
2. Building Asset (property aspect)
3. Link them together
4. Set up governance and features

---

## 🎯 Overview

An apartment building in OrangeCat has **two parts**:

1. **Building Group** - The community of residents
   - Members: All residents
   - Governance: How decisions are made
   - Treasury: Shared expenses (utilities, maintenance)
   - Events: Building meetings, social gatherings

2. **Building Asset** - The physical property
   - Property value
   - Location
   - Documents (deeds, insurance)
   - Can be used as collateral for loans

**They're linked:** The building group owns the building asset.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:

- ✅ You have an OrangeCat account
- ✅ You're logged in
- ✅ You have a Bitcoin wallet connected (optional, for treasury)

---

## Step 1: Add "Building" as Group Label (One-Time Setup)

**Note:** This is a one-time developer task. Once done, all users can create building groups.

**File:** `src/config/group-labels.ts`

```typescript
import {
  // ... existing imports ...
  Building, // Add this
} from 'lucide-react';

export const GROUP_LABELS = {
  // ... existing labels ...

  building: {
    id: 'building',
    name: 'Building',
    description: 'Residential building with shared governance and expenses',
    icon: Building,
    color: 'slate',
    defaults: {
      is_public: false,
      visibility: 'private', // Only residents can see
    },
    suggestedFeatures: ['shared_wallet', 'events', 'proposals'],
    defaultGovernance: 'consensus', // Residents decide together
  },
} as const satisfies Record<string, GroupLabelConfig>;
```

**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Result:** "Building" now appears as an option when creating groups.

---

## Step 2: Create Building Group (Community)

### 2.1 Navigate to Create Group

For this example, let's start from scratch.

### 2.3 Fill Out Group Form

**Group Type Section:**

- **Label:** Select **"Building"**
  - This sets smart defaults (private visibility, consensus governance)

**Basic Information:**

- **Group Name:** `Sunset Apartments`
- **Description:**
  ```
  A 20-unit residential building in Zurich.

  maintenance, and building improvements.
  ```

  - All residents must agree on major decisions
  - Alternative: `Democratic` (majority vote)

3. Automatically added as member

### 4.3 Member Roles

## Step 5: Create Building Asset (Property)

2. Select: **"Sunset Apartments"** (your building group)
3. This sets the `actor_id` to link group → asset

**Alternative (if UI doesn't support yet):**

- Create asset with your user as owner

### 5.4 Submit

- ❌ Voting feature: Database schema exists, but no service layer/API/UI
- ✅ Events: Fully implemented (use for building meetings)
- ✅ Treasury: Fully implemented (manual management)

**Workaround for Now:**
