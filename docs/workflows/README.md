# Workflows

Operational procedures for common development tasks.

---

## Deployment

Production runs **self-hosted on the Hetzner box** (`bitbaum`, behind Caddy)
since 2026-06-12. CI (GitHub Actions) gates merges but does **not** deploy.

→ See [`../deployment/DEPLOYMENT_PROCESS.md`](../deployment/DEPLOYMENT_PROCESS.md).

## Database migrations

Schema changes are SQL files in [`../../supabase/migrations/`](../../supabase/migrations/),
applied with `psql` against the self-hosted Supabase instance
(`supabase.orangecat.ch`). There is no managed-cloud dashboard or Management API.

```bash
psql "$POSTGRES_URL" -f supabase/migrations/<timestamp>_<name>.sql
```

→ Full workflow: [`../supabase/migrations-guide.md`](../supabase/migrations-guide.md).
→ Verify auth/registration after a migration: `scripts/db/verify-self-host.sh`.

> Management-API migration workflow were retired 2026-06. Those runbooks
