# Workflows Documentation

This directory contains proven workflows and operational procedures for common development tasks.

---

## 📚 Available Workflows

### 1. Deployment Workflow

Production deploys happen on the Hetzner box since 2026-06-12 — see
`docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT_PROCESS.md`. (The old `w` / Vercel pipeline this
section used to describe was removed with the migration.)

---

### 2. Supabase Migration Workflow

> ⚠️ **RETIRED — managed cloud only.** The migration workflow docs in this section (`SUPABASE_MIGRATION_WORKFLOW.md`, `MIGRATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`, `MIGRATION_LESSONS_LEARNED.md`) and the `PROJECT_REF` / `api.supabase.com` scripts they describe targeted the managed Supabase Cloud, retired 2026-06. Schema work now happens against the self-hosted instance (`supabase.orangecat.ch`, Hetzner box) via SQL migrations + `psql`. Kept for historical reference.

**File:** `SUPABASE_MIGRATION_WORKFLOW.md`

**Use this when:** You need to apply database migrations to Supabase

**Contains:**

- Complete step-by-step workflow
- Authentication setup
- SQL validation techniques
- Debugging methodology
- Reusable script template
- Common pitfalls and solutions

**Quick Start:**

```bash
node scripts/db/apply-migration.js supabase/migrations/your-migration.sql
```

---

### 2. Migration Quick Reference

**File:** `MIGRATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`

**Use this when:** You need fast lookup for common migration tasks

**Contains:**

- 3-step quick start
- Common fixes (one-liners)
- Error code reference table
- Verification queries
- Minimal script template

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# Check token
grep SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN .env.local

# Apply
node apply-migration.js migration.sql

# Verify
# Use queries in doc
```

---

### 3. Migration Lessons Learned

**File:** `MIGRATION_LESSONS_LEARNED.md`

**Use this when:** You want to understand what went wrong in the past and how we fixed it

**Contains:**

- Chronological timeline of attempts
- Every error encountered with root cause
- SQL syntax error patterns
- Systematic debugging approach
- Success factors analysis
- Future proofing recommendations

**Key Learning:**

- Read tokens dynamically from `.env.local`
- Validate SQL syntax before applying
- Fix one issue at a time
- Use Supabase Management API directly

## 🔧 Essential Scripts

### Migration Scripts

**Primary script:**

```bash
node scripts/db/apply-social-features-migration.js
```

- Auto-reads token from `.env.local`
- Applies timeline social features migration
- Full error handling and reporting

**Alternative script:**

```bash
node scripts/db/apply-timeline-migration.js
```

- Same functionality as above
- Points to same migration file
- Can be used interchangeably

**Generic template:**
Create new migration scripts based on the template in `SUPABASE_MIGRATION_WORKFLOW.md`

---

## 📋 Common Tasks

### Apply a New Migration

```bash
# 1. Ensure token is current
grep SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN .env.local

# 2. Create migration file
# supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDD_description.sql

# 3. Apply migration
node scripts/db/apply-migration.js supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDD_description.sql

# 4. Verify
# Run verification queries from MIGRATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
```

### Fix "Unauthorized" Error

```bash
# 1. Get new token from Supabase Dashboard
# Settings → API → Copy "Service role key"

# 2. Update .env.local
echo "SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=sbp_your_new_token" >> .env.local

# 3. Retry migration
```

### Fix SQL Syntax Error

```bash
# 1. Read error message for line number
# Example: "LINE 163: syntax error at or near CASE"

# 2. View that line
sed -n '163p' migration.sql

# 3. Fix according to PostgreSQL rules
# - Wrap expressions in parentheses for CREATE INDEX
# - Order function params: required before optional

# 4. Retry migration
```

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### Migration Failed in Production

**Do NOT panic. Follow these steps:**

1. **Check if partially applied:**

   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name LIKE 'new_table_%';
   ```

2. **Read error message carefully:**
   - Extract error code (42601, 42P13, etc.)
   - Find line number in error
   - Identify specific issue

3. **Fix and retry:**
   - Fix only the identified issue
   - Don't make multiple changes
   - Test fix, then retry

4. **Rollback if needed:**
   - Drop created tables: `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`
   - Drop created functions: `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS`
   - Document what was rolled back

5. **Test in staging first:**
   - If available, test fixed migration in staging
   - Verify success before production retry

# 1. Check token exists
grep -q SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN .env.local && echo "✅ Token found" || echo "❌ Token missing"

# 2. Check migration script exists
test -f apply-social-features-migration.js && echo "✅ Script found" || echo "❌ Script missing"

# 3. Check Node.js installed
node --version && echo "✅ Node.js ready" || echo "❌ Node.js missing"
