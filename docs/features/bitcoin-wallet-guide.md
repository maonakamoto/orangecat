## Overview

The Bitcoin Wallet Guide is a dedicated page that helps users who don't have a Bitcoin wallet get one set up quickly and easily. This feature addresses a common barrier for new users who want to receive Bitcoin donations on OrangeCat but don't know how to get started with Bitcoin.

## Purpose

Many users come to OrangeCat wanting to create projects or profiles but get stuck when asked for a Bitcoin address because they don't have a Bitcoin wallet yet. This guide provides:

1. **Clear explanations** of what a Bitcoin wallet is
2. **Curated wallet recommendations** with pros/cons
3. **Step-by-step guidance** for getting started
4. **Security best practices** for new users
5. **FAQ section** addressing common concerns
