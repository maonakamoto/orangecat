-- Index projects into the search corpus (Phase 4 of build↔find).
--
-- Projects are the "what's being built" side of the market — including work
-- published from FleetCrown. They fit the generic indexable branch (title +
-- description, gated on status='active'); this just reconciles their writes
-- into content_embeddings via the same webhook the supply tables use, so a
-- project becomes discoverable by MEANING, not only exact keyword. Idempotent.
