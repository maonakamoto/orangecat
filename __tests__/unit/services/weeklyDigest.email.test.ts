/**
 * Weekly digest email — builder→template contract.
 *
 * The digest pipeline was never scheduled and never ran in production.
 * When the cron was finally installed (2026-06), the builder's output shape
 * (digestBuilder.ts WeeklyDigestData) no longer matched the template's input:
 *   1. suggestions were {text, actionLabel, actionUrl} objects → the template
 *      called escapeHtml(object) → TypeError → EVERY send failed silently
 *   2. stats keys drifted (totalPaymentsReceived vs payments, paymentAmountBtc
 *      vs amountBtc) → payment stats silently dropped → "quiet week" emails
 *      for users who actually received payments
 * buildWeeklyDigestEmail is the single mapping point; this suite pins it
 * using data shaped exactly like the builder's output.
