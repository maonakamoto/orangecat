/**
 * Locks the deterministic pieces of the Cat's entity-type selection quality:
 *
 * 1. The system prompt carries the decision rubric (service vs product vs
 *    project/cause vs loan vs event vs group) and REQUIRES a one-line
 *    "why this type" with every proposal.
 * 2. A money NEED reaches the tool pass (loan drafting) and counts as a
 *    create intent, never a platform search.
 * 3. The prefill tool result instructs the model to explain the type choice.
 *
 * The founder-reported failures these guard: a service proposed as a
 * product/project, no explanation given, and loans never suggested.
